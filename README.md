# Case-Study-2 Covid in Mexico

Dataset can be found here - https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/informacion-referente-a-casos-covid-19-en-mexico

For this case study I was using Postgresql and Tableau.

"case_study_2_processing.sql" contains more info about the dataset itself and operations done to clean and process it.
"case_study_2_analysis.sql" is filled with queries performed to analyse the data. 

Both files are documented with comments as to guide anyone who's willing to check/use these files for any purpose. 

Dashboard was made in Tableau Public and since it's uploaded as a .png file, it's non-interactive. 
Dashboard's interactive version can be found here - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/matt.l2298/viz/Covidcs2/Dashboard1
